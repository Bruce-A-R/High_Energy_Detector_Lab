buffer is the background data

I put the data we got and the jupyter notebook I used to parse the data files in here - Bruce

from the NaiTI_detector_Am notebooks, I got an energy-channel equation for this detector of:

E = 2.15810466(channel) -1.02238504

NOTE: I think I need to change the way I locate the middle of peaks tho, so this will be updated later when I or someone fixes that
