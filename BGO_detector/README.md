# BGO Detector Stuff

This is a folder of all measurements from the BGO detector
1. unangled: this is the unangled measurements for all sources, including a measurement of the background
2. Am_angled: this is the angled measurements for Am and another copy of the unangled measurement of Am
3. other files: files not in "unangled" or "Am_angled" folders are measurements we took which will not be used in the data analysis

   
Files uploaded have naming convention ending in relative degrees if angled. 
Files in "unangled" are named just by their source or "bg" for background. 
For clarity, 135 degrees here is 135 on the protractor which is 45 degrees from start point 
and 45 is similarly 45 on the protractor which is 135 from start point
