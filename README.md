# High_Energy_Detector_Lab
group repository for detector lab 

files, code, ect. should be in folders named for each detector. 
Hopefully aside from that we can all remember the naming conventions used for each thing

spectrum_reader.pynb can read any spectrum from either detector along with the corresponding backgroud, then converts counts to counts/sec and background subtracts
(thats what I have so far, will add peak finding and fitting soon) - Bruce
